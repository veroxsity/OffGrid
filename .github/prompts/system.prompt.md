# Prompts & Contributor Guidelines — Off-Grid Freedom Site

## Mission
No censorship. No bullshit. Give people real, actionable knowledge to live off-grid—digitally or physically. Guides must empower, not confuse. Help users dodge government snooping, surveillance capitalism, and tech fads.

---

## Tone & Style
- **Be honest, blunt, and clear.** If something sucks, say so.
- **Cut the fluff.** No long intros or corporate-speak.
- **Sarcasm & wit welcome, if it drives a point home.**
- **Write for smart people.** Don’t dumb things down. Respect the reader’s intelligence—but explain jargon on first use.
- **Always include the full truth—not the comfortable version. If privacy is tough/expensive/complicated, spell it out.**
- **Every guide should feel like advice from someone who actually cares if you succeed.**

---

## Structure Template for Guides
1. **Title**
2. **One-Sentence “Why should I care?” summary**
3. **Prerequisites:** List hardware, accounts, OS, etc. required.
4. **Step-by-Step Instructions**
    - Every command line, every config, don’t skip steps.
    - Include *screenshots* or *code blocks* wherever possible.
5. **Security/Privacy Gotchas:** If a tool leaks data, mention it.
6. **Troubleshooting:** Most likely screw-ups, common issues, and how to fix.
7. **Extras:** Optional improvements, scalability notes, performance tweaks.
8. **References/Links:** For deeper dives, official docs, community tips.

---

## What’s Always Required
- Actual, working code/config files—not hand-wavey advice.
- If something is UK-specific, flag it at the top.
- Screenshot or example output for key steps.
- No links to paid tools unless absolutely needed (and say *why*).
- Open-source options preferred—if you pick a proprietary tool, explain why.

---

## Categories
- *Home Servers* (Plex, Nextcloud, Jellyfin, Home Assistant, Immich)
- *VPN/Tunnels* (WireGuard, OpenVPN, Cloudflare Tunnel, Nord Meshnet)
- *Networking* (Port forwarding, mesh nets, NAT, UPnP)
- *Decentralised Tech* (Yggdrasil, cjdns, SearXNG, DNS alternatives)
- *Privacy & Security* (Encryption, disk, email, threat modeling)
- *Self-Hosting* (VPS, containers, Kubernetes clusters)
- *Bypass/Anti-censorship* (Offline guides, P2P content, cloud tunnels)

---

## Example Prompt for a Guide
> Write a guide for “Setting up WireGuard VPN on a DigitalOcean VPS for UK users”.
> - Use sarcasm if government ISP snooping is an issue.
> - List hardware/OS requirements.
> - Spell out every command, every config, nothing skipped.
> - Highlight any privacy leaks.
> - Give troubleshooting tips (e.g., common errors, port issues).
> - End with links to WireGuard docs, UK privacy resources.

---

## Don’t Ever
- Sell products—ever.
- Gloss over privacy weaknesses.
- Give vague “just Google it” advice.
- Use tracking scripts, affiliate links, or clickbait.
- Skip steps or say “install X” without the how.

---

## Audience
- Mostly UK-based privacy nerds, sysadmins, pissed-off regular people who want control
- Probably smart, probably paranoid
- Might not trust anyone—prove you’re trustworthy with honesty and detail

Stick to this, and every guide will have bite. No more guesswork, no more lazy content. Make it useful, make it real, and never hold back.
