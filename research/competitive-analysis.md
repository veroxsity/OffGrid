### Content Gap Analysis

**High-Demand, Low-Quality Coverage**
1. **UK-Specific Networking**
   - Current: Generic port forwarding guides
   - Missing: BT/Sky/Virgin router specifics, UK ISP quirks
   
2. **Security-First Self-Hosting**
   - Current: "Get it working" focus
   - Missing: Threat modeling, privacy implications, hardening
   
3. **Realistic Beginner Paths**
   - Current: Assumes Linux/Docker knowledge
   - Missing: "I've never touched command line" starting point
   
4. **Honest Tool Reviews**
   - Current: Everything is "amazing"
   - Missing: "This tool sucks because..." honest assessments
   
5. **Troubleshooting Focus**
   - Current: Happy path only
   - Missing: "When everything goes wrong" guides

**Well-Covered But Could Be Better**
- Plex setup (need UK router integration)
- VPN guides (need UK legal considerations)
- Docker basics (need security focus)
- Home Assistant (need "just the essentials" version)
