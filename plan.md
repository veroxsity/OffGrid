# Comprehensive Development Plan — Off-Grid Freedom Site

This is the deep dive. No guesswork — you can take this and execute from nothing to full-scale platform.

---

## **PHASE 1 — Research & Architecture**
- Survey privacy/dev communities on Reddit, Lemmy, Hacker News.
- Identify “voids” in off-grid tutorials coverage.
- Lock in content scope: target 50 detailed guides for v1.
- Create site map with core categories + subcategories.
- Plan language support (EN, DE, ES initially).
- Security-first design choice: privacy before convenience.

---

## **PHASE 2 — Build Foundation (Weeks 1–4)**
- Git repo + branching strategy (`main`, `dev`, feature branches).
- Next.js frontend skeleton + Tailwind setup.
- Node/Express API with Hello World route.
- PostgreSQL init + Prisma schema: `users`, `guides`, `tags`, `favorites`.
- JWT auth + role system (admin, editor, reader).
- Configure Docker Compose for backend stack.
- Deploy staging environment on VPS.

---

## **PHASE 3 — Content Engine (Weeks 4–6)**
- Implement MDX content loader + renderer.
- Add syntax highlighting.
- Build search integration (Meilisearch/Elastic).
- Create seed data with 10 test guides.
- Write & test:
    - Plex install guide.
    - WireGuard on VPS.
    - Cloudflare tunnel setup.
    - Basic mesh networking (Yggdrasil).
- Include inline screenshots + video embeds in guides.

- Strict HTTPS w/ HSTS.
- CSP, XSS, and CSRF protection.

---

## **PHASE 6 — Testing & Launch (Weeks 10–12)**
- Invite beta testers (target 20-50).
- Load test backend for 1000+ concurrent readers.
- Final bug squashing & UI polish.
- Full public launch.

---

## **PHASE 7 — Growth & Future**
