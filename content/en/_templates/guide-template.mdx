# Example Guide Title (Replace Me)

Short intro: what we will build, why it matters, and the scope. Mention privacy-first defaults and safe operation.

> TL;DR: The exact high-level steps users will do (1–3 bullets). Include links to sections.

## Before you begin
- Confirm environment meets prerequisites
- Update the OS and install baseline tools
- Decide whether this will be LAN-only or exposed over the internet

```bash
# Update packages and basic tools
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
sudo apt -y install curl ca-certificates jq
```

What this does: Ensures the system is patched and has a minimal toolkit used by commands below.

## Architecture at a glance
- Component A → Component B → Users
- Data path: where files/configs live
- Ports used: TCP 80, 443, etc. (replace with actual)

> Note: Consider isolating the service in a container or a dedicated user for least privilege.

## Security model and defaults
- Run as non-root where possible
- Default deny inbound firewall; explicitly allow required ports only
- Avoid exposing admin interfaces directly to the internet; prefer VPN (WireGuard)

```bash
# Example UFW baseline
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp    # SSH (if needed)
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp   # Replace with actual ports
sudo ufw enable
```

What this does: Applies a conservative firewall stance so only necessary services are reachable.

## Step 1 — Install the software

Choose your installation method and keep it consistent (native or Docker). Replace the commands below.

```bash
# Native example (replace with actual package names)
sudo apt -y install exampled example-cli

# OR: Docker example
sudo docker run -d \
  --name example \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /srv/example:/var/lib/example \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  ghcr.io/vendor/example:latest
```

What this does: Installs the core service either from distro repos or as a container with persistent storage.

## Step 2 — Configure the service

Create the main config file with safe defaults. Show the minimal working config and annotate key lines.

```ini
# /etc/example/example.conf (replace with real path)
listen = 0.0.0.0:8080   ; Bind address and port
state_dir = /var/lib/example
log_level = info
# security: disable open signup and require auth
signup_enabled = false
```

What this does: Sets a working baseline with privacy-first defaults. Replace with real options.

Apply and enable on boot:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now example
```

Expected output: Service becomes active (running) and remains after reboot.

## Step 3 — Create an admin/user and secure credentials

```bash
# Replace with real CLI or API calls
example-cli user create --username admin --password 'CHANGE_ME'
example-cli roles grant --username admin --role admin
```

What this does: Creates a minimal admin account for initial login. Rotate to stronger auth (OAuth/SSO) when possible.

## Step 4 — Verify the deployment

- Check service status
- Test local and remote connectivity

```bash
sudo systemctl status example --no-pager
curl -I http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
curl -I http://SERVER_LAN_IP:8080/
```

Expected: HTTP 200/204 on health endpoints. If not, inspect logs below.

## Step 5 — Optional: HTTPS with a reverse proxy

If public access is needed, terminate TLS via Caddy/Traefik/Nginx Proxy Manager.

```bash
# Example: Caddyfile (replace domain)
example.example.com {
  reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8080
}
```

What this does: Provides automatic HTTPS and hides the app directly from the public internet.

## Backups and data location
- List all paths that must be backed up (config, data, DB)
- Provide a sample backup command and a restore test

```bash
sudo tar -czf /backups/example-$(date +%F).tgz /etc/example /var/lib/example
```

What this does: Captures configuration and state in a timestamped archive. Store off-host.

## Performance tuning
- Adjust worker counts/threads or DB cache sizes
- Verify memory/CPU usage with `top`, `htop`, or `docker stats`

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and checks:
- Ports in use or firewall blocking
- Permission errors on data directories
- Service crashes at start due to bad config

Useful commands:
```bash
# Logs
sudo journalctl -u example -n 200 --no-pager

# If containerized
sudo docker logs --tail=200 example

# Check open ports and listeners
ss -tulpn | grep -E ':8080|:80|:443'
```

What this does: Surfaces recent logs and verifies expected ports are listening.

## Security hardening checklist
- Disable guest/anonymous access
- Enforce strong passwords and/or SSO
- Limit management endpoints to LAN/VPN
- Keep software updated; subscribe to security advisories

## UK-specific notes (if applicable)
- ISP IPv6/CGNAT considerations
- Port-forwarding or Cloudflare Tunnel guidance
- Router-specific notes (BT/EE, Sky, Virgin, TalkTalk)

## Uninstall / rollback
```bash
# Native
sudo systemctl disable --now example
sudo apt -y purge exampled example-cli
sudo rm -rf /etc/example /var/lib/example

# Docker
sudo docker rm -f example
sudo rm -rf /srv/example
```

What this does: Removes packages/containers and persistent data. Ensure backups are taken before removal.

## FAQ
- Q: How do I change the default port?
  - A: Edit the config’s listen directive and restart the service.
