# Tailscale on Ubuntu (Mesh VPN + Exit Node)

Instantly connect devices without opening ports.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up
```

Follow the link to authenticate.

## Make this machine an exit node (optional)

```bash
sudo tailscale up --advertise-exit-node
```

Approve in the Tailscale admin console (Machines → this node → Enable exit node).

## Advertise a subnet (site-to-site)

```bash
# Example: advertise your LAN 192.168.1.0/24
sudo tailscale up --advertise-routes=192.168.1.0/24
```

Approve the route in the admin console. Clients can then enable it from their UI.

## Useful commands

```bash
# Status and peers
sudo tailscale status

# Force key refresh
sudo tailscale cert --renew

# Start at boot
sudo systemctl enable --now tailscaled
```

## Notes

- No router port forwarding required.
- Use ACLs to restrict who can access what.
- For DNS, enable MagicDNS in the admin console.
