# Cloudflare Tunnel on Linux (Expose Services Without Ports)

Use `cloudflared` to publish local services via Cloudflare’s edge.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb -o cloudflared.deb
sudo dpkg -i cloudflared.deb || sudo apt -f install -y
```

## Login and create a tunnel

```bash
cloudflared tunnel login
cloudflared tunnel create homelab
```

## Route a hostname

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns homelab app.example.com
```

## Configure and run

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/cloudflared
sudo tee /etc/cloudflared/config.yml >/dev/null <<'YAML'
tunnel: homelab
credentials-file: /home/$USER/.cloudflared/*.json
ingress:
  - hostname: app.example.com
    service: http://localhost:8080
  - service: http_status:404
YAML

sudo cloudflared service install
sudo systemctl enable --now cloudflared
```

## Tips

- Put multiple hosts under `ingress`.
- Use Cloudflare Zero Trust policies for auth in front of apps.
- If behind CGNAT, this avoids router changes entirely.
