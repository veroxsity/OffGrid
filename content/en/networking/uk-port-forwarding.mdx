# UK Router Port Forwarding Guide

> TL;DR: Find your device’s local IP, create a port-forward on your ISP router (external→internal port, correct protocol, correct internal IP), ensure the service is listening locally, then test from an external network. If it still fails, check for CGNAT/double NAT and consider VPN/tunnel alternatives.

**Every UK ISP router interface is different.** This guide covers the specific steps for major UK ISP routers to set up port forwarding for self-hosting services.

## Why Port Forwarding?

Port forwarding allows external devices to access services running on your local network. Essential for:

- Self-hosted web servers
- VPN servers (WireGuard, OpenVPN)
- Game servers
- Remote desktop access
- Security cameras

## Security Warning

**⚠️ Port forwarding exposes services to the internet.** Only forward ports for services you need accessible externally, and ensure they're properly secured.

## Before You Start

### Find Your Device's Local IP

**Windows:**
```cmd
ipconfig
```
Look for `IPv4 Address` (usually 192.168.x.x)

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
ip addr show
# or
ifconfig
```

**Router DHCP Table:**
Most routers show connected devices with IP addresses.

### Check Your Public IP
```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```

## Security Best Practices

### Use Non-Standard Ports
Instead of SSH on port 22, use port 2222:
- External Port: 2222
- Internal Port: 22
- Reduces automated attacks

### Restrict by IP (Advanced)
Some routers allow IP restrictions:
- Only allow specific external IPs
- Use for office/known locations

### Enable Router Firewall
Ensure router firewall is enabled alongside port forwarding.

### Monitor Open Ports
Check what's exposed:
```bash
nmap -p- [your-public-ip]
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Not Accessible Externally

1. **Check Internal Service:**
   ```bash
   # Test locally first
   nc -zv 192.168.1.100 80
   ```

2. **Verify Router Config:**
   - Correct internal IP
   - Correct port numbers
   - Rule enabled

3. **Test from External:**
   ```bash
   # From outside network
   nc -zv [your-public-ip] 80
   ```

### Double NAT Issues

**Symptoms:** Port forwarding configured but not working

**Check:** Router shows WAN IP as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x

**Solutions:**
- Contact ISP for bridge mode
- Use UPnP if available
- Consider VPS tunnel

### Dynamic IP Changes

**Problem:** IP address changes, breaking external access

**Solutions:**
- Dynamic DNS (DuckDNS, No-IP)
- Router DDNS features
- Monitor IP changes

### ISP Port Blocking

**Common blocked ports:**
- 25 (SMTP)
- 80 (HTTP) - some ISPs
- 135, 139, 445 (Windows)

**Solutions:**
- Use alternative ports
- Contact ISP for unblocking
- Use reverse proxy

## Advanced Configuration

### UPnP Alternative
Some services support automatic port mapping:
```bash
# Enable UPnP on router
# Service automatically requests ports
```

### DMZ Host
**Last resort:** Place device in DMZ
- All ports forwarded to one device
- **Security risk:** Only for isolated testing

### VPN Alternative
Instead of multiple port forwards:
- Set up VPN server
- Access all services through VPN tunnel
- More secure than exposing individual services

## Router-Specific Issues

### BT: Hub Manager App
Some settings only available via BT Hub Manager app:
- Download from app store
- Connect to home WiFi
- Access advanced settings

### Virgin: Super Hub 3 Modem Mode
If using own router:
- Enable modem mode
- Configure port forwarding on your router
- Not Virgin's hub

### Sky: Shield Interference
Sky Shield can block services:
- Disable Sky Shield
- Or add service exceptions

## Testing Your Configuration

### Online Port Checkers
- portchecker.co
- whatismyipaddress.com/port-scanner
- canyouseeme.org

### Command Line Testing
```bash
# Test specific port
nc -zv [your-public-ip] [port]

# Test from different network
# Use mobile data or friend's network
```

### Router Status
Most routers show active port forwarding rules and current connections.

**Port forwarding configured successfully?** Your self-hosted services should now be accessible from the internet. Remember to keep services updated and secured.

Next steps: Set up Dynamic DNS to handle IP address changes, or configure a VPN for secure remote access to all your services.
