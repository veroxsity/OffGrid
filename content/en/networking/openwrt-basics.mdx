# OpenWrt Basics: Install and First Steps

Modern, open firmware for supported routers.

## 1) Flash

- Download the correct factory image from openwrt.org for your model.
- Use the stock firmware upgrade page to flash; avoid power loss.

## 2) Secure and update

- Set root password on first login (`http://192.168.1.1`).
- SSH in and update packages:

```bash
opkg update && opkg list-upgradable | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | xargs -r opkg upgrade
```

## 3) Wi‑Fi and SSID

- Network → Wireless → set SSID, WPA2/3, strong passphrase.

## 4) DNS and DHCP

- To use Pi-hole: Network → DHCP and DNS → Upstream DNS: `192.168.1.2` (Pi-hole IP).
- Static leases for servers: Network → DHCP and DNS → Static Leases.

## 5) Backup/restore

- System → Backup / Flash Firmware → Generate archive.

## Notes

- Prefer WPA2/WPA3 mixed for compatibility.
- Keep router cool; poor thermals cause instability.
