# Plex Media Server on Ubuntu

## TL;DR
Set up your own Netflix that you control, with all your media accessible anywhere. Fuck subscription services.

## What You Need

- **Hardware**: Any computer with 4GB+ RAM (Raspberry Pi 4 works for direct play)
- **Software**: Ubuntu 22.04 or 20.04 (this guide), SSH access
- **Internet**: Stable connection for remote access
- **Storage**: External HDD/SSD for your media (USB 3.0 recommended)
- **Time**: 2-3 hours including troubleshooting
- **Cost**: £0/month (one-time hardware cost)
- **Skills**: Basic command line comfort

## Why Plex Over Alternatives?

**Plex Pros:**
- Works with every device (Smart TVs, phones, consoles)
- Automatic metadata and artwork
- Remote access that actually works
- User management for family

**Plex Cons:**
- Requires account creation (privacy concern)
- Some features locked behind Plex Pass
- Phones home to Plex servers

**Alternatives considered:** Jellyfin (open source, harder setup), Emby (paid), Kodi (local only).

## The Setup

### Step 1: Update Your System

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**What this does**: Gets latest security patches. Always do this first.

**Expected output**: Long list of packages updating. Reboot if kernel updated.

### Step 2: Create Media Directories

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /media/plex/{movies,tv,music}
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /media/plex
```

**What this does**: Creates organized folders for your content with proper permissions.

### Step 3: Mount Your External Storage

Find your drive:
```bash
sudo fdisk -l
```

**Look for**: Your external drive (usually `/dev/sdb1` or similar). Note the device name.

Mount it permanently:
```bash
# Replace /dev/sdb1 with your actual drive
sudo mkdir /mnt/external
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/external

# Make it permanent
echo '/dev/sdb1 /mnt/external ext4 defaults 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

**Screenshot needed**: Show `fdisk -l` output with drive highlighted.

### Step 4: Install Plex Media Server

Add Plex repository:
```bash
curl https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | sudo apt-key add -
echo deb https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list
```

Install Plex:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install plexmediaserver -y
```

**What this does**: Downloads and installs Plex from official repository.

Start and enable Plex:
```bash
sudo systemctl start plexmediaserver
sudo systemctl enable plexmediaserver
```

Verify it's running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status plexmediaserver
```

**Expected output**: Should show "active (running)" in green.

### Step 5: Access Plex Web Interface

Open your browser and go to:
```
http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:32400/web
```

**Find your server IP:**
```bash
hostname -I | awk '{print $1}'
```

**What you'll see**: Plex setup wizard. Sign up for free Plex account (unfortunately required).

### Step 6: Configure Libraries

1. Click "Add Library"
2. Choose "Movies" → Browse → `/media/plex/movies`
3. Choose "TV Shows" → Browse → `/media/plex/tv`  
4. Choose "Music" → Browse → `/media/plex/music`

**Tip**: If you see permission errors, run:
```bash
sudo chown -R plex:plex /media/plex
```

## Security & Privacy Notes

- **Data Collection**: Plex collects viewing statistics and shares with studios. Can't be fully disabled.
- **Account Required**: Plex requires online account even for local streaming. Privacy trade-off.
- **Remote Access**: Uses Plex relay servers by default. Can be disabled for paranoid users.
- **Updates**: Auto-updates enabled by default. Check release notes for breaking changes.

**Disable Plex relay (optional):**
Settings → Network → "Enable Relay" → Disable

## When It Goes Wrong

### "Server not found" errors
**Problem**: Can't access Plex web interface
**Fixes:**
1. Check if service is running: `sudo systemctl status plexmediaserver`
2. Restart service: `sudo systemctl restart plexmediaserver`
3. Check firewall: `sudo ufw allow 32400`
4. Verify IP address: `hostname -I`

### Libraries don't show content
**Problem**: Added media but doesn't appear
**Fixes:**
1. Check permissions: `ls -la /media/plex/`
2. Fix ownership: `sudo chown -R plex:plex /media/plex/`
3. Scan library: Settings → Libraries → Scan Library Files
4. Check file formats: Plex supports MP4, MKV, AVI. Avoid WMV.

### External access not working
**Problem**: Can't stream outside home network
**Fixes:**
1. **UK Router Issues**: BT/Sky/Virgin routers often block this
2. Port forward 32400 in router settings
3. Use dynamic DNS (DuckDNS recommended)
4. Enable UPnP in Plex settings (Settings → Network)

**UK-specific router guides:**
- BT Hub: Advanced → Port Forwarding → Add rule (32400, both TCP/UDP)
- Sky Hub: Advanced → Port Forwarding → Gaming/App sharing
- Virgin Media: Advanced → Port Forwarding → Manual

### Transcoding issues (video stuttering)
**Problem**: Videos buffer or won't play on some devices
**Fixes:**
1. **Weak hardware**: Raspberry Pi struggles with transcoding
2. Lower quality settings: Settings → Transcoder → Lower quality
3. Direct play when possible: Convert media to MP4 H.264
4. Consider Intel QuickSync or NVIDIA hardware acceleration

## Making It Better

### Hardware Acceleration
If you have Intel CPU with QuickSync:
```bash
# Add plex user to video group
sudo usermod -a -G video plex
sudo systemctl restart plexmediaserver
```

Enable in Plex: Settings → Transcoder → Hardware Acceleration → Intel QuickSync

### Automatic Media Organization
Install FileBot for renaming:
```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jre-headless
wget -O filebot.deb https://get.filebot.net/filebot/FileBot_4.9.6/FileBot_4.9.6_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i filebot.deb
```

### Remote Access Without Port Forwarding
Use Cloudflare Tunnel (separate guide):
- No router configuration needed
- Free tier available
- Better security than port forwarding

### Storage Optimization
Use mergerfs for multiple drives:
```bash
sudo apt install mergerfs
# Combines multiple drives into single mount point
```

## UK-Specific Considerations

### ISP Blocking
- **Virgin Media**: May throttle streaming traffic during peak hours
- **BT**: CGNAT on some connections prevents port forwarding
- **Sky**: Parental controls can block Plex domains

**Solutions:**
- Contact ISP for static IP if on CGNAT
- Use VPN or tunnel for consistent access
- Disable ISP-provided parental filtering

### Legal Considerations
- **Personal Use**: Streaming your own content is legal
- **Sharing**: Don't share libraries with friends outside household
- **Content**: Only stream media you legally own
- **Recording**: TV recording for personal use is legal under UK law

### Power Costs
Running 24/7 at UK electricity rates:
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: ~£15/year
- **Mini PC (50W)**: ~£80/year  
- **Old Desktop (200W)**: ~£320/year

Calculate yours: (Watts ÷ 1000) × 24 × 365 × £0.30 = annual cost
