# BookStack (Wiki) with Docker

> TL;DR: Run MariaDB + BookStack, set `APP_URL` to your domain, reverse proxy with TLS, complete the installer, and back up the DB and `config` volume.

## Before you begin
- Choose a domain (e.g., wiki.example.com) and plan to proxy with HTTPS
- Generate strong DB credentials

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  db:
    image: mariadb:11
    container_name: bookstack-db
    environment:
      MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD: change-me
      MARIADB_DATABASE: bookstack
      MARIADB_USER: bookstack
      MARIADB_PASSWORD: change-me
    volumes:
      - ./mariadb:/var/lib/mysql
    restart: unless-stopped

  app:
    image: linuxserver/bookstack
    container_name: bookstack
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_USER=bookstack
      - DB_PASS=change-me
      - DB_DATABASE=bookstack
      - APP_URL=https://wiki.example.com
    ports:
      - "6875:80"
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    depends_on:
      - db
    restart: unless-stopped
```

What this does: Runs MariaDB with persistent storage and BookStack with persistent config/uploads.

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:6875` (or your proxy URL) and complete the setup
- Create the first admin user and log in

## Backups
```bash
# DB dump + config archive
docker exec -t bookstack-db mysqldump -u root -pchange-me bookstack | gzip > backups/bookstack-db-$(date +%F).sql.gz
sudo tar -czf backups/bookstack-config-$(date +%F).tgz ./config
```

## Troubleshooting
- 502 via proxy
  - Ensure container is healthy and proxy forwards to port 80 of `bookstack`
- Login or CSRF issues
  - Confirm `APP_URL` matches your public URL and TLS
- Database connection failed
  - Verify DB env vars and that `db` service is up

## Security hardening checklist
- Put behind TLS and enable HSTS at the proxy
- Restrict public registration; use role-based permissions
- Regularly back up DB and uploaded files

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./mariadb ./config
```
