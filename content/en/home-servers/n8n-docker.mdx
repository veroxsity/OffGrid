# n8n (Automation) with Docker

> TL;DR: Run n8n with basic auth enabled, set `WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` to your public URL if needed, persist data, and reverse proxy with TLS.

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n:latest
    container_name: n8n
    environment:
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=change-me
      - WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL=https://n8n.example.com
      - N8N_HOST=n8n.example.com
      - N8N_PORT=5678
    ports:
      - "5678:5678"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/home/node/.n8n
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:5678` (or proxied domain) and log in with basic auth
- Create a simple workflow and execute it

## Backups
```bash
sudo tar -czf /backups/n8n-$(date +%F).tgz ./data
```

## Troubleshooting
- Webhooks not reachable
  - Ensure your public URL is correct and proxy forwards to 5678
- Permissions issues writing data
  - Ensure the host directory is writable by container user

## Security hardening checklist
- Put behind TLS and consider additional auth (OIDC) at the proxy
- Rotate credentials; avoid default passwords

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./data
```
