# Sonarr with Docker

> TL;DR: Deploy Sonarr with persistent config and correct volume mappings so it can see both your downloads and your library; then add indexers and a download client.

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  sonarr:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/sonarr:latest
    container_name: sonarr
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
    ports:
      - 8989:8989
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - /srv/media/series:/tv
      - /srv/downloads:/downloads
    restart: unless-stopped
```

What this does: Ensures Sonarr can import from `/downloads` to your `/tv` library.

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:8989`
- Settings → Download Client: add qBittorrent/Transmission
- Settings → Indexers: add via Jackett/Prowlarr or built-ins

## Backups
```bash
sudo tar -czf /backups/sonarr-$(date +%F).tgz ./config
```
What this does: Archives Sonarr configuration for quick recovery or migration.

## Troubleshooting
- Import errors (path not found)
  - Ensure the same host paths are mounted into both Sonarr and your downloader to avoid path mismatches.
- Permissions issues
  - Use matching PUID/PGID across media containers; set ACLs/permissions on host folders.

## Security hardening checklist
- Put the web UI behind a reverse proxy with auth and TLS
- Avoid exposing port 8989 to the internet

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./config
```
