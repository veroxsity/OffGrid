# Jellyfin Media Server with Docker

Free, open-source media server. Stream locally or via reverse proxy.

## 1) Compose file

```yaml
services:
  jellyfin:
    image: jellyfin/jellyfin:latest
    container_name: jellyfin
    user: "1000:1000"   # match your user:group ids
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - ./cache:/cache
      - /srv/media:/media:ro
    ports:
      - "8096:8096"    # HTTP
      # - "8920:8920"  # HTTPS (optional)
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/London
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/jellyfin && cd ~/jellyfin
docker compose up -d
```

Visit `http://SERVER_IP:8096` to complete setup.

## 2) Hardware acceleration

- Intel iGPU: add device `/dev/dri`:

```yaml
    devices:
      - "/dev/dri:/dev/dri"
```

- NVIDIA: install host drivers + `--gpus all` (compose: `deploy.resources.reservations.devices`).
- Enable hardware accel in Dashboard â†’ Playback.

## 3) Reverse proxy tips

- With Nginx Proxy Manager, forward to `http://jellyfin:8096` and enable WebSockets.
- Set Jellyfin public base URL if using a subpath.

## 4) Backups

- Backup `./config` regularly.
- Library paths are read-only; keep media outside the container.

## Troubleshooting

- No transcoding: verify `/dev/dri` permissions or NVENC availability.
- Remote buffering: use H264 for max compatibility; consider bitrate limits.
