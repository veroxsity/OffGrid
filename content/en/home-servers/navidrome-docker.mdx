# Navidrome (Self-hosted Music) with Docker

> TL;DR: Run Navidrome with a persistent data directory and a read-only music mount, create an admin, and scan your library. Put behind TLS.

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  navidrome:
    image: deluan/navidrome:latest
    container_name: navidrome
    user: "1000:1000"
    ports:
      - "4533:4533"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - /srv/music:/music:ro
    environment:
      - ND_LOGLEVEL=info
      - ND_SCANSCHEDULE=1h
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:4533` → create admin
- Set Music Folder to `/music` and run a scan

## Backups
```bash
sudo tar -czf /backups/navidrome-$(date +%F).tgz ./data
```

## Troubleshooting
- Library not found
  - Check that the host path `/srv/music` is correct and mounted read-only inside the container
- Playback outside LAN
  - Put behind a reverse proxy with TLS; configure external URL/base path if needed

## Security hardening checklist
- Don’t expose 4533 publicly; proxy with HTTPS and auth
- Create per-user accounts; avoid sharing admin

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./data
```
