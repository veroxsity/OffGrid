# Linkding (Bookmarks) with Docker

> TL;DR: Run Linkding with a persistent data directory, create the admin user, and put it behind TLS.

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  linkding:
    image: sissbruecker/linkding:latest
    container_name: linkding
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/etc/linkding/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:9090`, create the first user

## Backups
```bash
sudo tar -czf /backups/linkding-$(date +%F).tgz ./data
```
What this does: Archives bookmarks database and config for safe restore.

## Troubleshooting
- Admin user creation page not shown
  - Clear browser cache or restart container; ensure `./data` is writable and not pre-populated with conflicting state.

## Security hardening checklist
- Serve via HTTPS behind a reverse proxy; avoid exposing 9090 publicly
- Use strong passwords; restrict signups or admin access

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./data
```
