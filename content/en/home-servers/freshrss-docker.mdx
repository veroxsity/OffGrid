# FreshRSS with Docker

> TL;DR: Start FreshRSS with persistent volumes, complete the web installer, schedule updates, and back up `data` and `extensions`.

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  freshrss:
    image: freshrss/freshrss:latest
    container_name: freshrss
    ports:
      - "8086:80"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/var/www/FreshRSS/data
      - ./extensions:/var/www/FreshRSS/extensions
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:8086` → finish installation wizard
- Create an admin and add feeds

## Backups
```bash
sudo tar -czf /backups/freshrss-$(date +%F).tgz ./data ./extensions
```

## Troubleshooting
- 502 via proxy
  - Ensure container is healthy and port mapped
- Feeds not updating
  - Check cron/cronjobs in app settings; ensure PHP timeouts aren’t exceeded

## Security hardening checklist
- Put behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS and auth
- Disable unauthenticated public access unless necessary
- Keep the image updated and rotate admin passwords regularly

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./data ./extensions
```
