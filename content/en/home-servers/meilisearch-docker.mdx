# Meilisearch with Docker

> TL;DR: Run the Meilisearch container with a persistent volume and a strong master key, open the admin UI, generate search-only keys for clients, and back up the data directory.

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  meilisearch:
    image: getmeili/meilisearch:latest
    container_name: meilisearch
    environment:
      MEILI_MASTER_KEY: change-me
      MEILI_ENV: production
    ports:
      - "7700:7700"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/meili_data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

What this does: Launches Meilisearch with persistent storage and a master key for admin operations.

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:7700` and authenticate with the master key.
- Create an index and add documents via the UI or API.

## Backups
```bash
sudo tar -czf /backups/meili-$(date +%F).tgz ./data
```

## Troubleshooting
- 401 Unauthorized
  - Ensure you pass `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header.
- Container restarts
  - Check volume permissions; ensure the host path is writable by the container user.

## Security hardening checklist
- Store the master key in an `.env` or secret; rotate regularly
- Use search-only and admin keys with least privilege for apps
- Put behind a reverse proxy with TLS and rate limiting

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./data
```
