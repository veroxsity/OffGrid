# qBittorrent with Docker

Run qBittorrent with a persistent config and secure the web UI.

> TL;DR: Start the container, change the default admin password immediately, map downloads correctly, and avoid exposing the web UI to the internet. Optionally run behind a VPN container.

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  qbittorrent:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/qbittorrent:latest
    container_name: qbittorrent
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
      - WEBUI_PORT=8081
      - UMASK=002
    ports:
      - 6881:6881
      - 6881:6881/udp
      - 8081:8081
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - /srv/downloads:/downloads
    restart: unless-stopped
```

What this does: Exposes BitTorrent ports and the web UI, and persists settings in `./config`.

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:8081`
- Default credentials are `admin` / `adminadmin` → change immediately (Tools → Options → Web UI)
- Set download paths under Options → Downloads to `/downloads`

## Optional: run behind a VPN (gluetun)
- Use a VPN container (e.g., `qmcgaw/gluetun`) and attach qBittorrent to its network stack with `network_mode: "service:gluetun"`
- Only publish ports on the VPN container

## Troubleshooting
- Web UI not reachable
  - Check container is listening on 8081; verify firewall
- Poor connectivity
  - Ensure port 6881 TCP/UDP is forwarded from your router (or rely on VPN provider’s port-forward feature)
- Permission errors writing to downloads
  - Align `PUID/PGID` with the owner of `/srv/downloads`; adjust UMASK

## Security hardening checklist
- Do not expose port 8081 to the internet; put behind a reverse proxy + auth or VPN
- Change admin password and consider whitelisting LAN subnets
- Enable encryption preference in BitTorrent settings; consider blocklists

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./config /srv/downloads/*
```
