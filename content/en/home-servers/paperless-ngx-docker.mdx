# Paperless-ngx (Document Management) with Docker

> TL;DR: Deploy Redis + Paperless-ngx, persist `data` and `media`, drop files into `consume`, create an admin, configure OCR languages, and back up volumes.

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  broker:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    container_name: paperless-redis
    restart: unless-stopped

  webserver:
    image: ghcr.io/paperless-ngx/paperless-ngx:latest
    container_name: paperless
    depends_on:
      - broker
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/usr/src/paperless/data
      - ./media:/usr/src/paperless/media
      - ./consume:/usr/src/paperless/consume
    environment:
      - PAPERLESS_REDIS=redis://broker:6379
      - PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY=change-me-random
      - PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE=eng
      - USERMAP_UID=1000
      - USERMAP_GID=1000
    restart: unless-stopped
```

What this does: Runs Paperless-ngx with Redis as a broker and persistent volumes for data/media.

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:8000` and create an admin
- Copy a PDF into `./consume` and watch it appear in the UI after processing

## Backups
```bash
sudo tar -czf /backups/paperless-$(date +%F).tgz ./data ./media
```

## Troubleshooting
- Files not processing
  - Check worker logs in the container; verify Redis connectivity
- OCR language
  - Install additional Tesseract langs or set `PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE` accordingly

## Security hardening checklist
- Put behind a reverse proxy with TLS and auth
- Limit who can access the instance
- Keep up-to-date and prune old media previews if space is tight

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./data ./media ./consume
```
