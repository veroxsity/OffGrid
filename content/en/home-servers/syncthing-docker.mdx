# Syncthing (Private File Sync) with Docker

Sync folders across devices over LAN/Internet.

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  syncthing:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/syncthing:latest
    container_name: syncthing
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - /srv/sync:/data
    ports:
      - 8384:8384   # Web UI
      - 22000:22000/tcp
      - 22000:22000/udp
      - 21027:21027/udp # discovery
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Start and open `http://SERVER_IP:8384`.

Add devices by ID, share folders, and approve.

## Notes

- For WAN use, forward 22000 TCP/UDP.
- Back up `./config`.
- Use versioning per-folder for safe rollbacks.
