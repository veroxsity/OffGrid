# Syncthing (Private File Sync) with Docker

Sync folders across devices over LAN/Internet.

> TL;DR: Start the container, open the web UI, pair devices by ID, share folders, and enable versioning. Forward 22000 TCP/UDP for WAN.

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  syncthing:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/syncthing:latest
    container_name: syncthing
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - /srv/sync:/data
    ports:
      - 8384:8384   # Web UI
      - 22000:22000/tcp
      - 22000:22000/udp
      - 21027:21027/udp # discovery
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:8384`, note your Device ID
- Add a second device’s ID; approve pairing on both ends
- Share a folder and watch it sync

## Notes
- For WAN, forward 22000 TCP/UDP on your router (or use a VPN/Tailscale)
- Back up `./config` and enable per-folder Versioning

## Troubleshooting
- Can’t discover peers
  - Ensure UDP 21027 is not blocked; check global discovery settings.
- Slow sync
  - Verify CPU/disk constraints; increase connections or adjust rate limits.

## Security hardening checklist
- Set `GUI Authentication User/Password` in the Syncthing UI
- Restrict GUI to LAN; put behind a reverse proxy + auth if exposing
- Use TLS for GUI if exposed; prefer VPN for remote access

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./config /srv/sync
```
