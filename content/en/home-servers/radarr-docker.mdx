# Radarr with Docker

> TL;DR: Run Radarr with correct volume mappings so it can see downloads and your movies library; add your download client and indexers.

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  radarr:
    image: lscr.io/linuxserver/radarr:latest
    container_name: radarr
    environment:
      - PUID=1000
      - PGID=1000
      - TZ=Europe/London
    ports:
      - 7878:7878
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - /srv/media/movies:/movies
      - /srv/downloads:/downloads
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:7878`
- Add your download client and indexers

## Backups
```bash
sudo tar -czf /backups/radarr-$(date +%F).tgz ./config
```
What this does: Archives Radarrâ€™s configuration so you can restore settings after updates or migration.

## Troubleshooting
- Import fails
  - Ensure the downloader and Radarr share the same host paths; otherwise use Remote Path Mapping.
- Permission denied
  - Align PUID/PGID and fix folder permissions.

## Security hardening checklist
- Put behind a reverse proxy with authentication and TLS
- Do not expose 7878 to the internet

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./config
```
