# Home Assistant with Docker

> TL;DR: Run Home Assistant in host network mode for discovery, back up the `config` folder, and access the UI at 8123.

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  homeassistant:
    image: ghcr.io/home-assistant/home-assistant:stable
    container_name: homeassistant
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
    network_mode: host  # recommended for discovery
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:8123` and follow onboarding

## Backups
```bash
sudo tar -czf /backups/home-assistant-$(date +%F).tgz ./config
```

## Troubleshooting
- Devices not discovered
  - Host networking is required for many discovery protocols; ensure itâ€™s enabled and firewalls allow multicast
- Corrupted config
  - Use the built-in Config Validator; restore from backup

## Security hardening checklist
- Use long-lived access tokens and enable MFA for accounts
- Put behind TLS if accessing remotely; prefer VPN
- Limit add-ons and integrations to trusted sources

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./config
```
