# Uptime Kuma (Self-hosted Status Page) with Docker

Simple monitoring with notifications and public status pages.

> TL;DR: Start the container with a persistent volume, create an admin user, add monitors, configure notifications, and back up `./data`.

## Deploy

```bash
mkdir -p ~/uptime-kuma && cd ~/uptime-kuma
cat > docker-compose.yaml <<'YAML'
services:
  uptime-kuma:
    image: louislam/uptime-kuma:latest
    container_name: uptime-kuma
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    restart: unless-stopped
YAML

docker compose up -d
```

What this does: Launches Uptime Kuma and persists state under `./data`.

## Verification
- Open `http://SERVER_IP:3001` and create an admin account
- Add an HTTP monitor to verify alerts

## Notifications
- In Settings â†’ Notifications, add providers (Telegram, Discord, Email, etc.)
- Test a notification to ensure delivery

## Backups
```bash
sudo tar -czf /backups/uptime-kuma-$(date +%F).tgz ./data
```

## Troubleshooting
- Container restarts
  - Check volume permissions; ensure host has free space.
- No alerts
  - Verify notification config and per-monitor settings.

## Security hardening checklist
- Put behind a reverse proxy with TLS
- Use a strong admin password; enable 2FA once available
- Limit public status page exposure if it reveals sensitive uptime data

## Uninstall / cleanup
```bash
docker compose down
rm -rf ./data
```
