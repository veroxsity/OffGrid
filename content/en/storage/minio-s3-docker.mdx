# MinIO (S3-compatible) with Docker

## Compose

```yaml
services:
  minio:
    image: quay.io/minio/minio:latest
    container_name: minio
    environment:
      MINIO_ROOT_USER: admin
      MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD: change-me-strong
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    ports:
      - "9000:9000"  # S3 API
      - "9001:9001"  # Console
    command: server /data --console-address ":9001"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Access the console at `http://SERVER_IP:9001`.

Create a bucket and an access key/secret for apps.
